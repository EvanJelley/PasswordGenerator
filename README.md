# PasswordGenerator

# This is a small python script that will generate a password for the user. It takes in the requirements (length, uppercase, lowercase, symbols, or numbers) and randomly generates a secure password. It also begins by asking the user if they would like a "super" password. This is the based on the qulification set forth by Hive Systems for the most secure passwords. They are 18 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. They cannot be practically broken into using brute force techniques. 

# Area for improvement in this project would be interface design. I am still early in my programming journey and have not begun learning UI. Therefore, this is merely a backend script that would sit nicely in a succintly laid out application.
